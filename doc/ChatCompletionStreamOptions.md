------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**includeUsage** | **bool** | If set, an additional chunk will be streamed before the `data: [DONE]` message. The `usage` field on this chunk shows the token usage statistics for the entire request, and the `choices` field will always be an empty array.   All other chunks will also include a `usage` field, but with a null value. **NOTE:** If the stream is interrupted, you may not receive the final usage chunk which contains the total token usage for the request.  | [optional]
