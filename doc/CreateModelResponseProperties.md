## Properties
Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**metadata** | **BuiltMap&lt;String, String&gt;** | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.   Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.  | [optional] 
**topLogprobs** | **int** | An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to return at each token position, each with an associated log probability.  | [optional] 
**temperature** | **num** | What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but not both.  | [optional] [default to 1]
**topP** | **num** | An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.  We generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.  | [optional] [default to 1]
**user** | **String** | A stable identifier for your end-users.  Used to boost cache hit rates by better bucketing similar requests and  to help OpenAI detect and prevent abuse. [Learn more](/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#end-user-ids).  | [optional] 
**serviceTier** | [**ServiceTier**](ServiceTier.md) |  | [optional]
