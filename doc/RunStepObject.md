**createdAt** | **int** | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run step was created. | 
**assistantId** | **String** | The ID of the [assistant](/docs/api-reference/assistants) associated with the run step. | 
**threadId** | **String** | The ID of the [thread](/docs/api-reference/threads) that was run. | 
**runId** | **String** | The ID of the [run](/docs/api-reference/runs) that this run step is a part of. | 
**type** | **String** | The type of run step, which can be either `message_creation` or `tool_calls`. | 
**status** | **String** | The status of the run step, which can be either `in_progress`, `cancelled`, `failed`, `completed`, or `expired`. | 
**stepDetails** | [**RunStepObjectStepDetails**](RunStepObjectStepDetails.md) |  | 
**lastError** | [**RunStepObjectLastError**](RunStepObjectLastError.md) |  | 
**expiredAt** | **int** | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run step expired. A step is considered expired if the parent run is expired. | 
**cancelledAt** | **int** | The Unix timestamp (in seconds) for when the run step was cancelled. |

**metadata** | **Map<String, String>** | Set of 16 key-value pairs that can be attached to an object. This can be useful for storing additional information about the object in a structured format, and querying for objects via API or the dashboard.   Keys are strings with a maximum length of 64 characters. Values are strings with a maximum length of 512 characters.  | [default to const {}]
**usage** | [**RunStepCompletionUsage**](RunStepCompletionUsage.md) |  |
